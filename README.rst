Introduction
============

This can be considered an extension from another `public
repository <https://github.com/ACloudGuru/node-dev-dotfiles>`__ of
similar nature.

It is intended to be used to capture *personal* preferences and
environment configurations.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Bear in mind that there is some personal application preferences
   assumed here that are opinionated for MacOS, and tooling that you may
   not personally care about outside of working for the same
   organization as myself. I may evolve this over time, but ultimately
   have created this to satisfy my personal preferences at this time.

Personal DotFiles
=================

Version managed user environment configuration for developers running
ZSH.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a public repository, and as a general reminder and
   guidance, be aware of secrets and PII. Don‚Äôt commit personal data or
   secrets.

Prerequisites
=============

Xcode
-----

On a new machine Xcode is required for most anything.

Open a terminal, enter the following, then go for a coffee ‚òï‚Ä¶

.. code:: sh

   xcode-select --install

Homebrew
--------

Homebrew manages most of the utilities and apps we need to do the job.

Visit https://brew.sh to confirm install command is up to date.

.. code:: sh

   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

Follow ‚ÄúNext Steps‚Äù from the Homebrew installer‚Äôs terminal output.

Ensure it‚Äôs working before proceeding‚Ä¶

.. code:: sh

   brew -v

Install
=======

This repo clones into the ``$HOME`` path for consistent cross-machine
configuration. `See here for a tutorial on this
approach <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles>`__.

Run the `install
script <https://github.com/Skeeg/.dotfiles/blob/main/.personal/bin/install-dotfiles>`__
below.

.. code:: sh

   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skeeg/.dotfiles/main/.personal/bin/install-dotfiles)"

What does this script do?

1. Clones the repo to ``~/.personal/.cfg`` for working tree at ``~/``
   including:

   -  A ZSH config file ``.zshrc`` with sensible defaults
   -  A ZSH ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù config file ``.zshrc.local`` with some tuning
   -  ``dotgit`` alias to run git commands on this repo
   -  A plethora of functions and methods from setting up command
      logging history, to aliases, and some useful functions.

2. Ignores any user files that aren‚Äôt explicitly tracked
3. Installs app bundle with Homebrew‚Ä¶

   -  `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstucdio.com/>`__
   -  `Many others, see the full
      list <https://github.com/Skeeg/.dotfiles/blob/main/.personal/WorkBrewfile>`__
   -  There is `another
      Brewfile <https://github.com/Skeeg/.dotfiles/blob/main/.personal/PersonalBrewfile>`__
      stored as well that is not business oriented, but mainly here to
      show the methods for you to consider for experimentation.

4. Compiles an `Antibody <https://getantibody.github.io/>`__ bundle of
   ZSH plugins to load on shell init
5. Takes inputs for creating global git user config file
6. Establishes a `baseline
   gitignore <https://github.com/Skeeg/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/git/ignore>`__
   spec for common exclusions.

..

   üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ``.zshrc`` will also source ``.zshrc.local`` if it exists, so add
   any personal configs there.

Optional Apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other apps can be manually installed, e.g recommended:
`Alfred <https://www.alfredapp.com/>`__,
`Insomnia <https://insomnia.rest/>`__, `Warp <https://www.warp.dev/>`__.

Check those out and you can run this command at any time.

::

   brew install alfred insomnia warp
