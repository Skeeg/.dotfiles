# References and explanation
# If you use the `git config --global core.excludesFile "~/.gitignore"` method, 
# this file will currently be ignored.  This file is a default mechanism for
# ignoring files and I use it to establish a baseline environment for myself.
# To fail back to this file, run `git config --global --unset core.excludesFile`

# Gitignore documentation: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

# development environments needs.
